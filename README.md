# A-Study-On-Data-Augmentation-In-Voice-Anti-Spoofing

In this repository we added our solution to the ASVspoof2021 challenge. The repository contains a few files:

1. SpecAverage.py - this is a function used to either perform SpecAverage as stated in the paper, or the masking part of SpecAugment (by google).
2. normalization.py - a file containing the normalization schemes presented in the paper.
3. compression_augmentation.py - a file used to create compressed -> de compressed data out of the ASVspoof2019 LA data (but not limited).
